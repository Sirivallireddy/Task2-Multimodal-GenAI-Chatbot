# Multi-Modal GenAI Chatbot (Task 2)

This project demonstrates a multi-modal chatbot capable of handling
both text and image inputs. The application is built using Streamlit
to provide a simple web-based interface.

Due to current API access limitations for live Gemini vision models
in the Python SDK, the chatbot response is simulated to demonstrate
the complete GenAI interaction workflow.

## Features
- Text input handling
- Image upload support
- Multi-modal interaction flow
- Web-based interface using Streamlit

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the application:
   streamlit run app.py
